# MiRage

This is the MiRage project which captures and collates data from numerous MiR autonomous robots.

MiRage communicates with autonomous robots using standard REST API and the HttpClient class as part of the .Net Core C# language. The data from the robots is stored in a local MariaDB database and will be replicated to a Cloud solution using TLS encryption.
